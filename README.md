## Peony Sessions
Peony Sessions is a simple, lightweight productivity app built with Next.js that helps you organize tasks into boards and time your work using the Pomodoro technique. Think of it like a “Trello-lite” experience, designed specifically for productivity sessions.

- Editable Task and Board Names: Easily rename tasks or boards to keep things flexible as your work evolves.
- Pomodoro Timer: Stay focused with a built-in Pomodoro timer to work in timed sessions and break intervals.

## Inspiration
I named the app after peonies because I loved the visuals of Elina's home from Barbie’s Fairytopia in the field of peonies. Plus they're my favorite flower.
